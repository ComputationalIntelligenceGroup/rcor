# Random correlation matrices with Metropolis-Hastings

## Contents

* `metropolis.R`: implementation of a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for uniform
  sampling of correlation matrices.
- `time_experiment.R`: script that executes related state-of-the-art algorithms
  to measure execution time.
- `plot_utils.R`: utility functions for plotting.
- `plot.R`: script that generates the plots describing the properties of the
  algorithm, as well as the results of the time experiment.

## Usage

```bash
	Rscript time_experiment.R
	Rscript plot.R
```
The time experiment can be computationally intensive.
